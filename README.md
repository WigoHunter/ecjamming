# Introduction
Frontend web project starter template with Gulp, Livereload, PostCSS, CSSNext, Babel, ES6 features.  

# Why
This project starter pre-installs and sets up the basic configurations needed for a modern web development environment, powered by a series of Gulp plugins (PostCSS and Babel) and an easy local server by Express  

# Usage
Step 1: Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/WigoHunter/webstarter.git`.  
step 2: Run `cd webstarter`.  
step 3: Fire `npm install`.  
step 4: Download Google Chrome extension at `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei`.  
step 5: To open the local server (using express) concurrently watching all changes on html, css and js files, use my npm script `npm start` and click on the google chrome extension (livereload)'s icon to activate it.  

# What now?
And now, you now have your project up and running at `localhost:8000` and css files auto-compiled and -reloaded by PostCSS and CSSNext plus js files by Babel and ES2015.
